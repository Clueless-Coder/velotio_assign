Quiz are mentioned below in numerical order:
1. We are given a string having parenthesis like below "( ((X)) (((Y))) )" . We need to find the maximum depth of balanced parenthesis, like 4 in above example. Since 'Y' is surrounded by 4 balanced parenthesis.
If parenthesis are unbalanced then return -1.

2. Write a function to check whether two given strings are anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example "abcd" and "dabc" are anagram of each other.


3. Given two arrays: arr1[0..m-1] and arr2[0..n-1]. Find whether arr2[] is a subset of arr1[] or not. Both the arrays are not in sorted order. It may be assumed that elements in both array are distinct.
